    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to analyzing Local Field Potentials (LFPs) using Python. We will cover the entire pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to advanced analyses such as time-frequency analysis, coherence, and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). The methods used here are commonly applied to understand oscillatory dynamics, neuronal interactions, and synchronization in the brain.\n",
